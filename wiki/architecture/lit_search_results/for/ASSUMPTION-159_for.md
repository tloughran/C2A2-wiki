SEARCH-FOR-ASSUMPTION-159:
  Date searched: 2026-05-18
  Original item: ASSUMPTION-159
  Original statement: "agents.md imports Tom's 12 rules verbatim with one-line analogy note + vault-specific corollaries on Rules 5, 8, 9; single source of truth for both Claude agents and DeepSeek worker."

  PROVENANCE:
    Origin: 14a
    Chain: [14a → 15a]
    Original item: ASSUMPTION-159
    Item type: ASSUMPTION (stated)
    Transform at each step:
      14a: Extracted/Surfaced from 2026-05-17 c2a2-self-awareness-daily run (resumed cycle)
      15a: Searched for supporting literature
    Current status: PARTIALLY-SUPPORTED

  Supporting evidence found: Yes

  Sources:
    1. Wang (2011) 'Transfer Learning by Structural Analogy' (AAAI) — structural-alignment-based rule transfer is well-studied; works best when source and target share relational structure.
    2. Gentner & Markman (1997) — structural-alignment theory of analogy; supports the move from coding rules to vault rules via explicit mapping.
    3. Single-source-of-truth (SSOT) literature in software configuration (e.g. 12-factor app methodology) — strong support for canonical rule-files that multiple consumers read.

  Strength of support: Moderate

  Summary: The SSOT pattern for operating contracts is well-established in software engineering and DevOps; importing rules into a canonical agents.md is the canonical form. Analogical transfer of rules from one domain (coding) to another (vault/notes) is supported by structural-alignment theory when the mapping is made explicit — which the 'one-line analogy note + corollaries on 5/8/9' approach does. The combination is reasonable.

  Caveats: Corollary coverage of only Rules 5, 8, 9 leaves 9 rules transferred verbatim; PRESUMPTION-184 explicitly flags this as un-audited transfer. The SSOT pattern works only if all consumers actually read the file; the DeepSeek worker's adherence depends on prompt construction, not file-reading by the model.

  Recommendation: PARTIALLY-SUPPORTED

SEARCH-FOR-ASSUMPTION-159 (RE-TRIGGER cycle 1):
  Date searched: 2026-06-01
  Original item: ASSUMPTION-159
  Original statement: (see prior cycle for full statement; refreshed only)

  PROVENANCE:
    Origin: 14a
    Chain: [14a->15a,15b->15c->15d->15a,15b->15c]
    Original item: ASSUMPTION-159
    Item type: ASSUMPTION
    Transform at each step:
      cycle 0..0: prior search/disposition cycles (see blocks above)
      15d (2026-05-31): re-triggered on weekly cadence; next_check 2026-05-31 elapsed
      15a (cycle 1, 2026-06-01): re-searched for supporting literature
    Current status: refresh; no new supporting literature surfaced this cycle.

  Run context: Clean weekly drain via the c2a2-lit-search-pipeline scheduled task (15a/15b/15c), running one hour after the 14a/14b self-awareness pipeline. Cohort re-triggered by 15d on 2026-05-31 (weekly cadence fired on time; next_check 2026-05-31 elapsed). Unlike the 2026-05-17 run, there is NO overdue 15d-schedule backlog — this is a normal on-cadence refresh.
  Landscape check: Automated landscape spot-check this cycle (3 genuine web searches across distinct clusters: passwordless/one-tap-link & SMS-auth security; Levin-Hoffman-Kastrup idealist convergence; multi-agent LLM systems instantiating research traditions/consensus). All three reaffirmed prior for/against profiles; no material literature shift detected. Spot-check is a sample, not an exhaustive per-item search.

  New evidence weighed: No new supporting literature surfaced in the week since the last cycle. The prior cycles' supportive findings stand.

  Sources (new / refreshed): No new sources this cycle.

  Strength of support: Unchanged from prior cycle.

  Summary: Cycle-1 refresh confirms the prior cycle's finding. The supporting literature base has not materially shifted in the past week; no new supportive sources surfaced during this automated cycle. The recommendation carries forward unchanged.

  Caveats: An automated weekly refresh is bounded by the LLM's capacity to surface genuinely new external evidence; a human-driven literature scan or operational evidence from the C2A2 runs themselves would be the more sensitive signal for status change.

  Recommendation: refreshed; carry forward prior recommendation (PARTIALLY-SUPPORTED)

    Transform at each step:
      cycle 0..2: prior search/disposition cycles (see blocks above)
      15d (2026-06-28): re-triggered on weekly cadence (catchup run; next_check elapsed)
      15a (cycle 3, 2026-06-30): re-searched for supporting literature
    Current status: refresh; no new supporting literature surfaced this cycle.

  Run context: Clean weekly drain via the c2a2-lit-search-pipeline scheduled task (15a/15b/15c), running one hour after the 14a/14b self-awareness pipeline. Cohort re-triggered by 15d on 2026-06-28 (weekly catchup — first 15d fire since 2026-06-07; the 06-14 and 06-21 weekly runs did not fire, so the 06-28 run drained the accumulated due cohort). This 15a/15b/15c run processes that 147-item re-trigger cohort (124 carry-over weekly items at cycle 3 + 23 newer weekly items at cycle 1).
  Landscape check: Automated landscape spot-check this cycle (6 genuine web searches across distinct clusters: Goodhart's-law / surrogate-metric validity (count-rate as a productivity proxy); git pull --rebase --autostash safety on dirty / untracked working trees; dashboard data-freshness / staleness observability and per-widget as-of timestamps; human-in-the-loop quality-gate routing vs blanket deferral; SMS-OTP / passwordless authentication security momentum (NIST SP 800-63-4; UAE/India/Philippines 2026 deprecation deadlines); multi-agent LLM consensus / idealist-convergence). Security cluster reaffirmed STABLE-but-STRONG (anti-SMS-OTP regulatory momentum continues; NIST SP 800-63-4 excludes SMS OTP from AAL2). All other clusters reaffirmed prior for/against profiles; no disposition-flipping literature shift detected. Spot-check is a sample, not an exhaustive per-item search.

  New evidence weighed: No new supporting literature surfaced in the week(s) since the last cycle. The prior cycles' supportive findings stand.

  Sources (new / refreshed): No new sources this cycle.

  Strength of support: Unchanged from prior cycle.

  Summary: Cycle-3 refresh confirms the prior cycle's finding. The supporting literature base has not materially shifted; no new supportive sources surfaced during this automated cycle. The recommendation carries forward unchanged.

  Caveats: An automated weekly refresh is bounded by the LLM's capacity to surface genuinely new external evidence; operational evidence from the C2A2 runs themselves remains the more sensitive signal for status change.

  Recommendation: refreshed; carry forward prior recommendation (refreshed; carry forward prior recommendation (PARTIALLY-SUPPORTED))
